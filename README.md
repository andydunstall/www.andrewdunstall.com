# Personal Site
This contains my personal site at [andrewdunstall.com](https://andrewdunstall.com). I built this as I was getting frustrated with WordPress so it seemed simpler just to create a simple ReactJS app and host on AWS amplify. All articles are currently just hardcoded directly, since I don't post very often this seemed easier then using or building a CMS, though I'm trying to write more now so may look into it soon. The JS is a bit hacked together but seems to work ok so far.
